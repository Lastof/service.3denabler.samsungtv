# service.3denabler.sonytvW8
A conversion of PavelKuzub's script to Switch Samsung TV into 3D mode when playing 3D movie in XBMC to instead talk to Sony TVs

# Do not use
As might be obvious the code is not yet ready, so if you've followed the fork to here looking for a Sony version come back later.

# Compatibility
Only tested on my W8 Series KDL-42W829B. I believe the same IP Control system works with other models of Sony Smart TVs, but with no ability to test I have no way to check.
