# service.3denabler.sonytvW8
A conversion of PavelKuzub's script to Switch Samsung TV into 3D mode when playing 3D movie in XBMC to instead talk to Sony TVs

# Not yet stable
The changes now work on my local setup, but the code hasn't been thoroughly tested or cleaned, so use at your own risk! A number of settings aren't yet configurable.

# Compatibility
Only tested on my W8 Series KDL-42W829B. I believe the same/similar IP Control system works with other models of Sony Smart TVs, but with no ability to test I have no way to check if my code works.
